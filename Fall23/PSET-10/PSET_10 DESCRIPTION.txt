  PSET_10  DESCRIPTION   Programming with Functions
***************************************************************************

An Internet Service Provider(ISP) has three different subscription 
packages for its customers:

   Package A:  For $15 per month with 50 hours of access provided.
               Additional hours are $2.00 per hour over 50 hours.
               Assume usage is recorded in one-hour increments, 
               

   Package B:  For $20 per month with 100 hours of access provided.
               Additional hours are $1.50 per hour over 100 hours.
               

   Package C:  For $25 per month with 150 hours access is provided.
	       Additional hours are $1.00 per hour over 150 hours

Assume the Billing Cycle is 30 days.

The ISP has contracted us to write the application softare for their
new Billing System. 

Recall that in WEEK 9 we wrote the following Functions to do the tasks:
         getPackage
         validPackage
         getHours
         validHours
         calculatePkg_A
         calculatePkg_B
         calculatePkg_C
which we will use to develop the application in Week 10.

For WEEK 10 we need to write an Interactive Console Application
using the Functions which you developed in Week 9. 

Write a Console Dialog Application in the main() function.
You will need to display a menu. The Input processing should only
be done using functions: getPackage, validPackage, getHours, 
validHours, and program control constructs.
The Calculation Processing should only be done using functions:   
calculatePkg_A, calculatePkg_B, calculatePkg_C, and program control constructs.
For Output Results you should display the Package Selected, Hours of
Usage, and the Amount charged for the month.

      Demonstrate test cases as described in table:
   
     Test Case        Package             Hours
	1		a		 70
	2		b		140
	3		c		220	

===================================================================
'Paste' your Console Dialog & Results from the Compiler Output Window
and 'Paste' your Source Code from the Compiler Source Code Window into
the "SUBMISSION TEMPLATE for PROGRAMMING SET 10" -- and SUBMIT into 
CANVAS by the Due Date: Wed April 7.

You can Download a "SUBMISSION TEMPLATE for PROGRAMMING SET 10 from
the WEEK_10 Course Module.
